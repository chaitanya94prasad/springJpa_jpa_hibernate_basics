#below property is added to enable h2 database UI. this can be accessed using the url http://localhost:8080/h2-console
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
#the url provided in h2 database UI is always incorrect so we usually pick the duynamically generated one
#from the startup log. but this keeps changing so it is not wise to use it
#hence we set our own url for database using below property
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
#if we want to see sql generated by jpa we can use this property
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
